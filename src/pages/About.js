        Enance was born from the experience of looking for a first-time Junior
        Developer role. <br />
        There are a lot of jobs out there, and each has its way of hiring new
        people. Some require 2-4 interviews, some less, some more. Others ask
        you to complete a take-home coding challenge, while others do not.{" "}
        <br />
        It doesn't matter if your background is University, Bootcamp or
        self-taught, you're 18, 30 or 60, there is a job out there for you.

        The coding challenge, for me, was one of the biggest mysteries. <br />
        What would it be? <br />
        How hard is it? <br />
        How long should I take? <br />
        The only way to prepare was to go through more interviews and attempt
        challenges. <br />

        There are a couple of problems with this: sometimes you don't get the
        interview, and sometimes when you submit your challenge you get ghosted
        and don't receive any feedback. <br />
        <strong>This is the gap that Enance aims to bridge.</strong>

        A note on the challenges

      <Text>
        When a company gives you a coding challenge they generally ask you to
        not make the challenge public. <br />
        In the interest of respecting this, the coding challenges here are
        slightly altered, however they still rely on the same concepts that are
        required to pass the challenge. For example: testing, API calls, DRY
        code, Object Oriented Programming etc.
