# News Search

## The Goal
Write a frontend application that queries the **[Guardian News API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/)**.  
The application should include a search input for users to search key words, returning the relevant articles.  

Whilst the main goal is the get the functionality working, we are focusing on design as well.  
In this challenge the UI choices are up to you, though at a minimum the articles should appear in a responsive grid of cards.  

### Prep:
* The language you write this in is up to you.  
* Being a frontend challenge there should be no need for a fullstack application such as Ruby on Rails though this is still acceptable.  
* You will need to sign up for an API key from the Guardian API website (link above)
### Some tasks:
* Keep the functionality separated in components, everything should not be in one file
* Clicking on an article card should redirect the user to the relevant story on the Guardian news website
* There should be a navbar at the top of the page
* The search input should be in the navbar

### Additional: 
On the Guardian news website, there is a popup on the bottom of the screen asking for donations - can you implement a similar popup in your application?  
This should just be a popup that appears when the user loads the page for the first time.  
Once the user has closed the popup, it should not appear again.
