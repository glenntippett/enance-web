# Shopping Cart

## The Goal

Using a language of your choosing write a shopping cart application that can calculate the cost of items in the shopping cart.  
You should write tests to satisfy the below conditions:  
* Create a ShoppingCart and add 2 "Books" for $9.95 each and 1 "Board Game" for $19.95, the ShoppingCart total price should equal $39.85  
* Create a ShoppingCart and add 3 "Books", then remove 1 "Book", and check that total price is correct: $29.85 - $9.95 = $19.90

## Notes

* This should be a terminal application
* Include a README of how to start and run the app
* It is not required for the user to manually add/remove the items, though this can be optional for you to include

## Extra Challenge
* If the shopper buys 5 or more items they receive a 5% discount
* If the shopper buys 10 or more items they receive a 10% discount
