# Login Form

## The Goal
Re-create the login form found on this **[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/LEF7ICNXTMiDHlcMqbAWHp/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)**.  
The form should be responsive and should look exactly as it does in the design on both mobile and desktop.  

This should ideally be done with plain old HTML and CSS, nothing more is required.  
Only once you have completed it with HTML and CSS should you try it with a framework such as React.  

**Why?**  
This is essentially a CSS challenge and is aimed at challenging you to follow a design that designers would give you in a workplace.  
Here you are limited to the UI choices made by the designer and it is your job to implement this.

## Design Notes

* Primary: #5100FC
* Primary hover: #6A24FF
* Secondary: #38181D
* Grey: #7E7E7E
* Font: Roboto
* Border radius: 8px

## FYI
* The login functionality does not need to work as this is just a frontend design challenge
* Pay attention to the different states of the design (such as hover and active)
