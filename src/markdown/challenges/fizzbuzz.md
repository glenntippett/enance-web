# FizzBuzz

## Background
FizzBuzz is a classic challenge for new developers.  
Whilst it might not be common out in the wild anymore it is a great one to practice setting up your environment for a challenge as well as writing tests. 

## The Goal
Print to the terminal numbers from 1 to 100.  
* If the number is a multiple of 3, replace it with 'Fizz'
* If the number is a multiple of 5, replace it with 'Buzz'
* If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with 'FizzBuzz'

An example output would be:  
``1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz...``  
and so on. 

Include tests to check the output.
