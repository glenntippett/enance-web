# What are the steps between submitting your resume and getting a job offer?

Getting your first job as a developer is hard.  
Sure, there's the odd story of some people who applied for one job and got it, but for the majority of us it is a tedious, grinding process - but it will all pay off.  
    
Not everyone gets past the first interview, so how can you prepare for what is to come?  
Well, hopefully this article helps.

**NB:** All companies have a different hiring process, so take the below with a grain of salt. However, they mostly all follow some sort of variation of the below steps.

### Step 1: Resume Submission
I'll have a separate post on tailoring your resume and cover letter, so let's assume you've done a good job here for now.  
Depending on the size of the company your resume may be read by someone in HR who is looking to check off a list that has been sent to them by the Head of Engineering, or it may be read by your *hopefully* new tech lead.  

They will essentially be looking at your prior experience, for a junior role this may be none. So they'll check your portfolio, side projects, education (uni? bootcamp?).  

Do the tech skills you've mentioned match up with what they are looking for?  

Looks good? Awesome, onto step 2.  

Side note: Some companies can get around 100 applications for a junior developer role, so if you're not in quick this may be where the application ends for you. So get in quick!

### Step 2: Phone Screening
Again, this step may be handled by someone in HR or the tech lead.  
The phone screening is essentially a brief chat about your resume and prior experience, they will want to get a feel for the kind of person you are, are you friendly? do you speak well? can you clear up any questions they have about the resume?  

If they like what they hear you're onto step 3.

### Step 3: The Technical Challenge
Alright, this is where things get interesting.  
It is hard to predict what type of challenge (if any) a company is going to give you *(hopefully this website will help better prepare you)*.  

Ok, now this step will depend on the job you're applying for:  

Frontend? You'll likely get asked to call an API and display the data somehow.  
Backend? Probably a terminal application where you will write an algorithm to solve a problem.  
Fullstack? Mix of both.  

Most companies will tell you the language they want you to do the challenge in, for example most banking companies will probably want it done in Java.  
An agency may want React.  
If you don't know the language they ask for the challenge in, you can most definitely ask the hirer if it is ok for you to submit it in a different language.  

Getting your first technical challenge can be exciting, it is a sign that you're moving forward in an interview.  
**But don't get too excited and try to finish the challenge in one sitting.**  

Take your time, you may still have a full time job, or may be studying, and the hirer will understand.  
Give yourself a few days to re-read the task and make sure you are presenting a work you are proud of.  

**You are allowed to ask the hirer questions about the task if anything is not clear.**  

Make sure you package the challenge nicely after completing and follow their instructinos for submission. Most of the time they do not want it publicly posted on GitHub.  

I will have a blog post coming up about the best practices for doing the technical challenge. 

### Step 4: Code Review
Great! You've submitted the challenge and now comes the agonising wait.  

Look, honestly, this is where you'll say goodbye to maybe 80% of your applications.  
It's not always a reflection on you. Remember, the hirers could be dealing with a lot of applicants and unfortunately being ghosted is very common.  

Don't be afraid to follow up with an email a few days after your submission to make sure they received it.  
If you get the dreaded *"Thanks, but no thanks"* - reply and thank them for their time and ask for their feedback on your technical challenge (just don't hold your breath on that).  

However, you may get a call saying they would like to chat further with you!  

Generally, this is a conversation with the engineering lead where you will discuss your technical challenge.  

Be prepared to talk about the struggles you had, what you liked and what you would improve if you had a week, a month or 6 months to work on it. 

### Step 4.5: Maybe another chat?
This step depends on who you did the code review with and it may not happen at all, maybe you will be asked to meet with some of the other developers to do a bit of culture fit, or maybe you will be asked to meet with the CTO/CEO (depending on the company size).  
Again, at this stage it is more to see how you get along with the other staff. This is as much for your benefit as it is for theirs.  

### Step 5: Reference Check
If everything is peachy the hirer will check your references.  
They'll generally ask you or let you know before calling the references but it is always best to give your references a heads up before handing them over to a hirer.

### Step 6: Offer!
Congratulations!  
If your references had nice things to say to you then you will probably be getting an offer at this stage, well done.  
This is super exciting, but remember - you don't have to accept right there and then.  
If anything felt slightly off during the interview process then feel free to take a day or two to think it over.  
Just make sure to keep the hirer in the loop so you don't waste their time. 

## Conclusion
That's a lot of steps...  
Again, each company is different and may only do a couple of these.  
The technical challenge may not be a take home challenge, it could be an in-person whiteboard challenge (not as likely).  

All-in-all this process can take anywhere from a week to a month, so strap in.  

Make sure you keep a spreadsheet or notes or something about all the jobs you apply for, who you are interviewing with and key dates.  
If anything, it will be a fun chart to look back on when you're some sweet dev.
