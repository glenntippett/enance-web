# Which language should you learn to get a job as a Developer?

I won't make you wait, the short answer - it doesn't matter.  

The longer answer - jump down to the conclusion.  

My advice would be to stick with whatever you're already learning.  
A whole lot of time can be wasted by hopping onto new languages whenever you hear about something new and shiny.  


#### Fundamentals
There are the three foundational languages you should learn: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
People will say that technically HTML and CSS are not programming languages, but rather HTML is a markup language and CSS is a stylesheet - I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - but it doesn't matter, they're still tools you should learn the basics of.  
I'll deep dive into these in another post.

So, what else?

#### JavaScript
JavaScript is a great language to focus on, it is becoming increasingly more powerful and has the added benefit of being both a frontend language and a backend language, **NodeJS**.  
This means you do not have to worry about learning or remembering different styles of syntax for different languages.  

JavaScript is the language used in popular frontend frameworks such as Angular, Vue, Svelte and React.  

Node (backend JavaScript) can also be used as a scripting language to replace Bash.

#### Ruby
This is one of my favourite languages and is great for beginners, it has an "easy to read" syntax so you are not often left guessing what a line of code means.  
After learning the basic Ruby syntax you are going to want to move onto **Ruby on Rails** - this is a fullstack framework for building web applications or API's using Ruby as your backend language.  

#### Python
Python is a popular language for Data Analytics, however it is also used in web development, particulary with the framework **Django**.  
Due to the growing popularity of Python and rich ecosystem of libraries, this is a great language to build web applications.

#### There's more
C#, PHP, Rust, Java, Golang... - there are a lot more languages to choose from which is why I say just stick to one for now. 

### Conclusion
Hey there - look, I hate it when I read a blog hoping to find the answer to a question and right at the bottom the author writes: *"it depends"*.  

What a cop-out.  

I'll try to not do that here.  

If you want an answer for the sake of an answer - JavaScript.  
Definitely learn the fundamentals of JavaScript before anything, but then move onto React for your frontend and Express for your backend.  

Boom.  

Go forth and learn and build.  

Of course we are missing the database layer in this post, but we'll discuss that another time.  

That being said, if you're already studying Python or Ruby or C# or PHP or whatever, keep doing that.  
You are going to get far more value from deep-diving into the language you are already learning and building as much as you can than if you learn a little bit of everything.  

If you then find a job that uses a different language you will find it much easier to pick up the new concepts - and Senior Devs are happy to answer questions about the little things that will come up.  

If you hate JavaScript, then try something else, employers just want to see that you can build things and work problems out for yourself.  
Before my first dev job (as a JavaScript dev) all my projects were a Ruby on Rails application, but at least there were projects to show and problems I had overcome which I could discuss in my interviews.
